For Jasper AI, I designed and deployed a cutting-edge hybrid cloud infrastructure using AWS, integrating on-premise systems with the cloud to create a flexible and scalable environment. This hybrid approach enabled Jasper AI to optimize their data workloads, balancing between cloud resources and on-premise systems to ensure cost-efficiency and high performance. By leveraging AWS and EC2, S3, and VPC, I provided a seamless cloud experience that not only met their immediate needs but also set the foundation for future growth and innovation.

### Securing Systems with Advanced Protections
Security was a core component of the infrastructure I built for Jasper AI. I implemented a multi-layered security framework that included AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for strict access controls, ensuring that only authorized personnel could access sensitive resources. Additionally, I utilized AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt data both in transit and at rest, protecting critical information from unauthorized access. Continuous monitoring was integrated with AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail, enabling real-time insights into security events and system performance to quickly identify and mitigate potential threats.

### Active Penetration Testing to Strengthen Defenses
To ensure the security of Jasper AI’s cloud infrastructure, I conducted regular and comprehensive penetration testing. By simulating real-world attacks, I identified potential vulnerabilities and provided actionable recommendations to mitigate risks. My proactive testing approach included assessing both the cloud infrastructure and application layers, ensuring that all potential entry points were thoroughly evaluated. The findings from each round of testing were used to implement necessary security improvements, ensuring that Jasper AI’s cloud environment remained resilient against emerging threats.

### Blue-Team Support for Ongoing Protection and Incident Response
In addition to building and securing the infrastructure, I provided blue-team support, continuously monitoring Jasper AI’s systems and responding to security incidents. My role included developing incident response protocols, conducting root cause analysis, and implementing corrective actions in the event of a breach or security event. I worked closely with the internal teams to ensure the highest standards of cybersecurity were upheld and that any potential risks were mitigated in real time, providing Jasper AI with a secure and responsive cloud environment to support their innovative initiatives.
