For Hexagon Creative, I developed over 200 custom WordPress websites for their clients, working closely with the design team to translate design files into fully functional websites. By creating bespoke themes that aligned with the client's design vision and required functionality, I ensured that each website was secure, fast, and optimized for performance.

### Building Custom WordPress Themes

My role involved building custom WordPress themes based on provided design files, implementing features to match client specifications. I worked extensively with HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript to ensure the themes were fully responsive, well-structured, and optimized for SEO. By integrating essential plugins and customizing their functionality, I ensured that each site met the specific needs of Hexagon Creative's clients.

### Optimizing and Maintaining Client Websites

In addition to theme development, I regularly optimized and maintained the websites to ensure their speed, security, and scalability. I implemented best practices for WordPress performance, including caching solutions, database optimization, and regular updates for plugins and WordPress core. By monitoring website health, I ensured Hexagon Creative’s clients had secure and high-performing websites with minimal downtime.

### Delivering Tailored Solutions for Client Success

I was committed to understanding each client’s unique needs, ensuring that the websites I developed reflected their brand and business goals. From custom functionalities to aesthetic refinements, I crafted solutions that provided an intuitive user experience, all while ensuring easy management for the clients through WordPress’s backend. This personalized approach enabled Hexagon Creative to consistently exceed client expectations and maintain long-term relationships.
